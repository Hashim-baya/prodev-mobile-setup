# 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

## üéØ Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the **Expo Framework** for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended IDE)  
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- **Expo Go App** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)  

These tools are **mandatory** for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## üìò Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development typically relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the constantly evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 ‚Üí iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware and performance.

**Expo Go** provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both **iOS** and **Android** seamlessly.
